## What is this?

This is a GUI-based program for converting skins or other sprite sheets for different versions of the browser game MRoyale. You can convert:
* Legacy skins to Deluxe format
* Remake skins to Deluxe format
* Legacy object mods to Deluxe format
* Remake skins to Legacy format
* Legacy smb_map to smb_map_new

## Why is this useful?

Let’s say you made a skin that was in MR Remake or MR Legacy and you want to use it in MR Deluxe. You know that player skins won’t be officially added to Deluxe but you still want to change the skin on your own computer with Redirector or something. But you also don’t want to spend half an hour remaking all your skins manually because you’d just be doing the same thing over and over.

Or let’s say you’re the owner of MR Legacy and you want to add swimming and taunt sprites to the game but it feels like an impossible task because you’d have to add them to every existing skin. What do you do?

Simple, use the skin converter! It’ll convert your old skins into files you can use with the latest version of the game!

## How do I use it?

There are two main ways to run this program:

1. On your computer. The app will run faster and look better but some programming experience is recommended. You’ll need to install Python and the “pillow” module. If you don’t know how to do either of these things or you aren’t allowed to install programs on your computer (e.g. because it’s a school computer), try option 2...
2. Online with Replit. This method is a little clunkier but it’s more beginner-friendly and supports basically any device, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebooks, Android, and iOS. Link: https://replit.com/@WaluigiRoyale/MR-Converter-3

## Troubleshooting (Online version only) 

### I can’t get it to run! All I see is a blank screen!

Try clicking “Stop” then clicking “Run” again. If that doesn’t work, clear your cache ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
