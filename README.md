## What is this?

This is a GUI-based program for converting skins or other sprite sheets for different versions of the browser game MRoyale. You can convert:
* Legacy skins to Deluxe format
* Remake skins to Deluxe format
* Legacy object mods to Deluxe format
* Remake skins to Legacy format
* Legacy smb_map to smb_map_new

While this program is not designed for maximum efficiency, it’s still pretty fast — as of version 5.2.1, it converts about 69.2 files per second.

## Why is this useful?

Let’s say you made a skin that was in MR Remake or MR Legacy and you want to use it in MR Deluxe. You know that player skins won’t be officially added to Deluxe but you still want to change the skin on your own computer with Redirector or something. But you also don’t want to spend half an hour remaking all your skins manually because you’d just be doing the same thing over and over.

Or let’s say you’re the owner of MR Legacy and you want to add swimming and taunt sprites to the game but it feels like an impossible task because you’d have to add them to every existing skin. What do you do?

Simple, use the skin converter! It’ll convert your old skins into files you can use with the latest version of the game!

## How do I use it?

There are two main ways to run this program:

1. On your computer. The app will run faster and look better but some programming experience is recommended. You’ll need to install Python and the “pillow” module. If you don’t know how to do either of these things or you aren’t allowed to install programs on your computer (e.g. because it’s a school computer), try option 2...
2. Online with Replit. This method is a little clunkier but it supports basically any device, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebooks, Android, and iOS. Link: https://replit.com/@WaluigiRoyale/MR-Converter-3

## System Requirements
This program doesn't have a very attractive interface. This is because I'd rather spend my time making the program *work*. In fact, it'll work on basically any operating system released in the last 15 years.

The online (Replit) version will work on any operating system that can run a modern web browser:
* MacOS 10.7 or later
  * MacOS 10.15– : Use Firefox or Chrome (or Safari on 12.0+)
  * MacOS 10.7–10.14: Use Chromium Legacy
* Windows 7 or later
  * Windows 10– : Use Firefox or Chrome
  * Windows 7–8.1: Use Firefox ESR

If you download the source code from this Github project's Releases, it should run on any operating system that can run Python 3.6 (though I've only tested it as far back as Python 3.7):
* MacOS 10.6 or later
* Windows Vista or later

You should also be able to use it on Linux (including Chrome OS) as well, but there are too many variations of that for me to provide any guarantees.

## Troubleshooting

### I can’t get it to run! All I see is a blank screen!

Try clicking “Stop” then clicking “Run” again. If that doesn’t work, clear your cache ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

### I downloaded the code, and when I run the program, it's in fullscreen!

You have a really old version of this app. Please download the newest version from the "Releases" section in the sidebar.
