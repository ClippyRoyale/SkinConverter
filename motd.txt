7.2.1 Welcome to v7.2.1! This is the last version that’ll feature full support for converting sprite sheets to Mario Royale Deluxe formats. Future releases will deprecate this functionality, and remove some old Deluxe-related files that haven’t been used for a while.        (This is also the last version I will release on Replit. Over the past year or so, Replit has become a slow AI-infested mess, and it's gotten to the point where I am literally unable to update my code because the page lags so much. I apologize for the inconvenience. Please message me on Discord if you know of any Replit alternatives that might work.)
