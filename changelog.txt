SKIN CONVERTER CHANGELOG

Version 1.0 (Feb. 12, 2022): Launch

Version 1.1 (Feb. 19, 2022): “default” command now only copies from same 
    position in template vs. new; added compatibility check

Version 1.2 (Feb. 21, 2022): Adds alternate image to copy from (“alt” and
    “copyalt” commands)

Version 1.3 (Feb. 27, 2022): Rewrote each command as a separate function instead
    of having one big if statement; “base” command to start from blank image

Version 1.3.1 (Aug. 29, 2022): Fixed empty-line check in copyalt

Version 1.4 (Oct. 10, 2022):
  + rotate and flip commands
  + filter command with basic grayscale and filter commands
  * Fixed bug where base_image was a reference to open_image rather than a copy
  * Only pay attention to the first occurrence of a given header command
    (previously, only the LAST one counted)
  * Restructured logic for optional arguments so there are fewer errors

Version 2.0 (Oct. 10, 2022)
NEW FEATURES:
  + Split filter into grayscale and invert commands (because future filters
    may have multiple arguments)
  + colorfilter command to adjust RGB color levels
EASE OF USE:
  + Compatibility check now automatically fixes problems on the fly with old 
    scripts (without making permanent changes to the scripts)
  + Prints save path so user knows the file will be overwritten
  + Warning if file doesn't start with “mrconverter”
  + Better error-catching: rejects commands if user doesn't provide enough 
    arguments
UNDER THE HOOD:
  + Massive rewrite to improve code readability.

Version 2.1 (Oct. 11, 2022): 
  + Special “.INPUT” path for open and save commands
  + More instructions on scripts the user can run
  * Fixed error checking for alt and template
  - Template no longer supports wildcards (*) in path because it made no sense

Version 2.2 (Oct. 25, 2022):
  + hue, saturation, lightness filters
  + fill command to fill a rectangular area with all one color
  * Better code organization
  + Added the W
  - Removed Herobrine

Version 2.2.1 (Oct. 31, 2022):
  + Allows script writers to exclude x and y values in filters to apply the
    filter to the whole image
  * Bug fixes
  * Preparing for a major update

Version 3.0 (Nov. 18, 2022):
  + Turned converter into a GUI
  + contrast filter
  + Converter is now usable on Replit, no Python installation needed
  + Added Remake-to-Deluxe skin conversion script
  * Many, many bug fixes, including lots of rare crash bugs
  + Added the W
  - Removed Herobrine

Version 3.0.1 (Nov. 19, 2022 / ONLINE ONLY):
  + Better instructions for online use

Version 3.0.2 (Nov. 20, 2022):
  + ReadMe file
  * Fixed bug in R2D and L2D skin conversion scripts that replaced a frame of
    the Fire climb animation with Fire power-down
  * Fixed allowing commas in filenames

Version 3.0.3 (Dec. 10, 2022):
  + More instructions for Replit users on how to import files
  + Only display message about entering fullscreen if Replit output window
    is too small
  * If script is missing version, default to current version instead of 0.0.0

Version 4.0 (Feb. 2, 2023):
  + Scripts for converting to Deluxe skins now convert to the 32×32 template
      * I will never write a script involving the “Remake 32×32” format that
        was never actually added to the game. Making any skins for that format
        without it being officially confirmed was a mistake to begin with.
        Speaking of Remake-related mistakes... chat.
      * I’m not going to write a DeluxeBeta -> Deluxe32 conversion script either
        because it was always a possibility that the template could change 
        without warning (it was a beta, after all)
  + colorize and sepia filters
  + tile command for creating repeating backgrounds
  + Back to Menu button
  + Improved dialog box code 
      * Text is less likely to overlap with icons or other text
      * Bottom text can now have paragraph spacing
  * Renamed most conversion scripts for consistency
  * Fixed the RGBA->HSLA converter which has been broken for who knows how long
  * “mrconverter”, “open”, and “save” lines are now optional
      * If a script is missing either line, the converter defaults to “.INPUT”
        as the path (i.e. asking the user what image they want to use)
  * Writing “copy”, “copyalt”, or “default” on their own now copies the entire
    source image onto the canvas. “clear” on its own clears the whole canvas. 
    “flip” on its own can be applied to the whole canvas, but not “rotate”
    because it expects a square area.
  - Deprecated Legacy Taunt script and Deluxe Beta scripts because they’re no
    longer useful
      * They’re still available in the standard installation, but I took away
        the buttons on the main menu so you’ll have to run them manually

Version 4.1 (Feb. 19, 2023):
  + "if" and "else" statements
      * Any code after an if command will be inside a block, until the converter
        encounters an "endif" command. Blocks can be nested. 
      * No "else if" yet, sorry
  + "empty" conditional command, to be used inside if to check if an area on
    the old image is empty/transparent
  + "duplicate" command, to duplicate an area on the converted image
  * Updated Obj L->Dx script to also convert Remake obj mods
      * The script uses if statements to automatically detect whether the 
        original mod is for Remake or Legacy
  * Updated all Skin->Dx32 conversion scripts to reflect latest templates
  * Rewrote parser to account for conditional commands
  - Removed Herobrine

Version 4.1.1 (Feb. 22, 2023):
  * Updated all 4 skin conversion scripts for Dx2.3.0 sprite sheet
      * Converted skins now have 16×32 Small sprites and a skin icon

Version 5.0.0 (Mar. 18, 2023):
  + More flexible interface
      * Dialog boxes can have multiple buttons
      * Dialog boxes are easier to place in code; they can be inline instead of
        having to trigger a function to continue
      * All buttons now fire on mouse button RELEASE instead of hold (more
        consistent with other apps)
  * Fixed obj conversion script to work with latest Deluxe obj
  - Game assets are now installed on first run rather than being included with 
    the program
      * This means if the game gets minor graphical updates, you won't have to
        wait for me to update the images. Of course if there's a larger update,
        I'll need to update the conversion scripts on my end anyway.
      * It also makes the program take up less space
  - Removed scripts for converting to Deluxe Beta skins (deprecated since 4.0)
      * They no longer had any use and were broken in recent releases
  * Requires Python 3.10 or later (union type hinting)

Version 5.0.1 (Mar. 20, 2023 / ONLINE ONLY):
  * Changed UI background color
  * Moving toward a shared UI codebase for this and Deluxifier 
  * Temp fix for crash bugs on repl.it
  * Requires Python 3.5 or later (type hinting)

Version 5.1.0 (Mar. 25, 2023):
  + "threshold" command to turn areas into 1-bit black & white
      * AKA "Hard-boiled" on the Wii Photo Channel
      * Useful for making silhouettes
  + "exit" & "error" commands to end conversion early
      * Intended to be put in if statements mostly
  + Remake-to-Deluxe obj conversion script
      * The Legacy-to-Deluxe script should work in most cases, but some objs may
        have credits areas that mess up the version detection
  * "endif" deprecated in favor of "end" (which will be used to end any block
    types added in the future)
      * "endif" will still be supported for backwards compatibility
  * UI improvements from Deluxifier: better bomb dialogs, automatically detect
  Replit for fullscreen
  * Readded union type hinting in a way that's compatible with Py3.5+
  * Fixed interface bug that was breaking dialog boxes
  * Fixed bug in the compatibility checker that's been present for an 
    embarrassingly long time
  * Fixed opacity command calling the threshold function
  - Removed internal dialog() function (shouldn't cause any end-user change)
  - Removed Herobrine

Version 5.2.0 (Apr. 13, 2023):
  + New batch conversion system that non-programmers can understand
  + Message of the Day dialog displays a message I can customize on Github
      * May be used for emergency messages (e.g. bug warnings) or just news
  + If user selects an invalid file at various points, they are now given the
    opportunity to choose a new file
  * Fixed dialog boxes so they don't treat "Cancel" clicks as "Okay"
  * Fixed Remake skin conversion scripts (no longer missing small swim/taunt)
  - Removed Herobrine

Version 5.2.1 (May 1, 2023): 
Can now run conversion scripts going back to v1.0 without modification

Version 5.2.2 (May 31, 2023): 
Fixed crash bug that occurred when running any script that generates warnings

Version 6.0.0 (Jul. 2, 2023):
  + Added variables
      * Set them with `set,$<name>,<value>`
      * Supported types: integers, strings, booleans (see below)
      * Get their values at any time with $<name>
      * Must set script version to 6,0,0 to use variables
  + Can now use subcommands anywhere, not just with if statements
  + Can now nest subcommands, e.g. (+,32,(*,$width,16))
  + Added a bunch of subcommands
      * MATH: +, -, *
      * EQUALITY: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
      * LOGIC: and, or, not
      * COLOR (return color value of a pixel or average for an area):
        red, green, blue, alpha 
  + goto command (go to a line number or a label set w/ the new label command)
  + while loops
      * “break” and “next” will be added later
  + Rewrote if statement parser to add support for “elseif”
      * And the code is actually readable now
  + if1 command as a simpler alternative to if/end
  + Boolean values: $_true and $_false (or $_t and $_f)
  + copy_from and default_from commands to copy from any loaded image by name
      * The ability to load extra images besides “old”, “template”, and “alt”
        will be added in a future update
  + Updated Message of the Day to match revisions from Deluxifier 3, plus an
    "Update available" header for update news
  + Updated Legacy Obj conversion script 
      + Thanks to variables, it can now convert Remake objs equally well
      - Deprecated the dedicated Remake Obj conversion script
        (still included in the “deprecated” folder, but no longer has a button
        on the menu)
  * Rewrote parser to allow for more blocks similar to “if” in the future
  * Commands are now case-insensitive
  - Deprecated "delete" as an alias for "clear" in scripts targeting v6+
      * It still works for now, but it could be removed at any time
  - Removed sidebar that showed conversion progress because it's not really that
    helpful anymore
  - Removed compatibility checker
      * It preceded the warning log and only covered ancient syntax changes
        and edge cases that never actually showed up
      * Going forward, compatibility issues will be fixed on the fly
  + Added the W
  - Removed Herobrine

COMING SOON: Path variables, lists, for?/foreach, switch, layers, 
  drawing commands,
  "from" as a subcommand to change the source image (from,template,red,0,0)
